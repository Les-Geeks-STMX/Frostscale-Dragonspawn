# Frostscale Dragonspawn

The goal of this project is to create a safe environment where anyone can be theimselves without any filters, riscs, or anything. 
My objectives are simple and very hard to do. And here they are for now:

On the server side, because yes, there will be one. At least, for now
- [ ] Create the core
  - [ ] Blockchain management
  - [ ] Security layers for servers
  - [ ] Security layers for users
  - [ ] An economic system based on eth or other.
  - [ ] User management
  - [ ] "Cyber Police"
  - [ ] Secures cloud sync (optionnal for users)
  - [ ] Contact system
  - [ ] Instant messagery
    > Short messages, no file exept images with low quality. Host need to be online.
  - [ ] e-mails
    > Long message with optionnal files up to 25Mb each, 10 files max, 100Mb total max
  - [ ] File hosting
    - [ ] Short term hosting, for sharing, used in email for large file
      > Safely stored using the P2P network. Records on the most active servers/users, 2 times per precaution, and 5 on unsure users (new or with network problems). For more information a md file named "DataProtection.md" will soon be created to explain how I plan to make the daat safe on personnal computers all arround the world.
    - [ ] Long term storage
      > This type of storage will be paid, the user will end up paying for how much data he stores each mounth, don't worry it won't be much, I'm planning to do $0.25/Gb/Mounth. It will help people and conveince more people to use low power computers or even their computer, and share what they're not using to the world. This is also to make space for every one.
